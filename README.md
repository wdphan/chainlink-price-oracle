# Chainlink Price Oracle

> USD/ETH Oracle Implementation

Oracles are data feeds that bring data from off the blockchain (off-chain) data sources and puts it on the blockchain (on-chain) for smart contracts to use. This is necessary because smart contracts running on Ethereum cannot access information stored outside the blockchain network. Attached is practice with utilizing Chainlink's ETH/USD price oracle.
